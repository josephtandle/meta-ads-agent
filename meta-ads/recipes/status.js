// enforces at runtime (config/config.json -> requiredEnvVars, which readiness.js
// resolves dynamically through process.env[name]). It reports presence and where
// each value came from (the process environment or the module's local .env file)
// and never reads a credential value. No Graph API request is made.
//
// Worth being precise about: src/api-client.js consumes only META_ADS_ACCESS_TOKEN
// and META_ADS_ACCOUNT_ID. META_ADS_APP_ID and META_ADS_APP_SECRET are required by
// the module's readiness contract (config/config.json) but no code in this release
// reads their values, so they gate the verdict without being consumed. That is
// called out rather than hidden behind a single boolean.
